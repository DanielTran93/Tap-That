# Tap-That

This was the first ever game I had created when learning Unity3D. This helped me learn how to implement Google play achievements, leaderboards and add Adsense advertisements to the game. It is a basic tap the button game. You tap 2 buttons until the numbers represent zero to defuse the bomb within the given time frame. Each time you do, another random pair of numbers appear on the buttons.
